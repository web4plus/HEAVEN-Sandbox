## Overview

This repository hosts the development of a cutting-edge, open-source artificial brain model that simulates the structure and functioning of biological neural networks. The goal of this project is to build a neuromorphic system that mimics the human brain's cognitive processes, including learning, memory, perception, and decision-making, using spiking neural networks (SNNs) and other advanced neuromorphic computing techniques.
