In total, in this version of the program (v.1.0.0), the following functionality is implemented:

        ‚ó¶ Interface for constructing of the nerve circuits;
        ‚ó¶ Simulation of the external cyberspatial environment; 
        ‚ó¶ BRIDGES: BODY < - > BRAIN Protocol
        ‚ó¶ Primary tools for the project management and analysis; 
 
Using the features developed in software, users can freely build, analyze and experiment with neuromorphic systems, easily connecting them to a prepared bodies within cyberspatial environments, through the BRIDGES protocol.
