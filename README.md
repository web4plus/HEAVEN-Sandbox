## [ üëæ About the project ]

 *  Founded over a decade ago as an experimental research, Heaven's team general purpose has become to develop an open-source and scalable artificial life model within the cyberspace, providing researchers and enthusiasts access to specialized software and a knowledge base for aCNS lifeforms development from scratch.
 *  We want to improve our technology, build a strong community of developers and enthusiats, and make hight quality infrastructure around the project, so it could develop as soon as possible. 

## [ üåê WEB3. What's next? ]

 As part of the Open Cyberspace, we aspire to be pioneers in the development of Internet 4.0, a vision that is becoming real thankfully to the latest advancements in WEB3, AI and GameDev.
